1. set the git:
  check the documentation if needed: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/github.html#register-existing-account

2. imports of packages:
  in cmd (as administrator) type: 
    python -m pip install requests

3. Change the secret to the one that is generated by you.
  In the future we need a way to hide the actual value for the api_key

4. work in your own branch
   After connecting to git please create your own branch with the following template: dev_yourName.
   Be carefull so that you don`t expose your api_key secret.
